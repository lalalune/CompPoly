  # Bivariate Multiplication Benchmark

  Manual benchmark comparing four strategies for bivariate multiplication over the
  KoalaBear field:

  1. **normal** — the schoolbook `CBivariate` product `p * q`;
  2. **kron** — Kronecker substitution with schoolbook univariate multiplication;
  3. **kron+NTT** — Kronecker with the classic NTT (`NTT.FastMul.withFallback`);
  4. **kron+FastNTT** — Kronecker with the recursive NTT (`NTTFast.withFallback`).

  All four results are checked for agreement at every size. Operands are square
  (`degX = degY = n`) and the Kronecker gap is `D = 2 * n`, which always satisfies
  `natDegreeX (p * q) < D`, so unpacking is faithful. Shared data (`mkBiv`,
  `bestDomainForLength?`, `kronWith`) lives in `KroneckerCommon.lean`; the agreement
  check lives in `Kronecker.lean`.

  Not part of the aggregate `CompPolyTests` build; run manually, e.g.
  `lake build CompPolyTests.Bivariate.KroneckerBenchmark`.

/-- Sweep of square sizes (`degX = degY = n`).

Kept modest because `#eval` runs in the interpreter; for larger sizes compile a native
executable (see the note at the bottom of this file). The NTT crossover on the packed
univariate operand (size `2 * n^2`) is already visible by `n = 16`–`32`. -/

  ## Running larger sizes

  `#eval` runs in the interpreter, which dominates the absolute timings (the relative
  comparison and crossover are still meaningful). For larger operands, compile natively:
  turn the `#eval` body into `def main : IO Unit` and add a `lean_exe` target to the
  lakefile, or run with `lake env lean --run` on a standalone copy. Native execution is
  typically two to three orders of magnitude faster, pushing the practical sweep well past
  `n = 32`.
