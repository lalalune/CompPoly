# Factorisation of Computable Bivariate Polynomials

Defines `evalYPoly` (substitute `Y ↦ f(X)`), `isLinearYFactor` (test
divisibility by `Y - f(X)`), and `divByLinearY` (synthetic division of a
bivariate polynomial by the monic linear factor `Y - f(X)`).

`divByLinearY` is the computable factor theorem for the nested representation
`CBivariate R = CPolynomial (CPolynomial R)`: given a root `f(X)`, it deflates
`Q` by `Y - f(X)` over an arbitrary commutative ring. It is
the degree-one special case of monic Euclidean division; division by an
arbitrary monic divisor in `Y` is available generically through
`CPolynomial.divByMonic` / `CPolynomial.modByMonic` over the coefficient ring
`CPolynomial R` (see `CPolynomial.modByMonic_add_mul_divByMonic`).
