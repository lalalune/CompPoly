# Bridge: synthetic linear division equals general monic division

Proves that the bespoke synthetic division `divByLinearY Q f` (Horner) coincides
with general monic Euclidean division of `Q` by the linear factor `Y - f`, using
the `CommRing`-general `CPolynomial.divByMonic` / `CPolynomial.modByMonic` at the
coefficient ring `CPolynomial R` (recall `CBivariate R = CPolynomial (CPolynomial R)`).

`divByLinearY_eq_divByMonic` shows the quotient equals `(divByLinearY Q f).1` and
the remainder equals `CPolynomial.C (divByLinearY Q f).2`, so `divByLinearY` is a
verified fast path for division by `Y - f`.

The proof works in the outer polynomial ring `(CPolynomial R)[Y]` (the image of
`CPolynomial.toPoly`): it rewrites the divisor as `X - C f`
(`linearYDivisor_toPoly`), establishes the Euclidean identity by transporting
`divByLinearY_spec` across the coefficient ring-equiv
(`divByLinearY_euclid_toPoly`), and concludes via
`Polynomial.div_modByMonic_unique`.
